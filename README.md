# Stable-Matching-SwingGUI

### Definition of the stable-matching problem:

Given n men and n women, where each person has ranked all members of the opposite sex in order of preference, marry the men and women together such that there are no two people 
of opposite sex who would both rather have each other than their current partners. When there are no such pairs of people, the set of marriages is deemed stable.

### Things to keep in mind:
- This program doesnt consider any options aside from boys marrying girls as the original problem states, but obviously you can use it with other examples like candidates 
 and companies.
- The same candidate cannot have the same option repeated.
